	Abstract = {We study the nitrogen binding curve with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and single-reference and multireference coupled cluster (CC) theory. Our DMRG calculations use up to 4000 states and our single-reference CC calculations include up to full connected hextuple excitations. Using the DMRG, we compute an all-electron benchmark nitrogen binding curve, at the polarized, valence double-zeta level (28 basis functions), with an estimated accuracy of 0.03 mEh. We also assess the performance of more approximate DMRG and CC theories across the nitrogen curve. We provide an analysis of the relative strengths and merits of the DMRG and CC theory under different correlation conditions.},

@article{BajdichMichalandMitas2009,
	Abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an advanced simulation methodology for studies of manybody quantum systems. In this review, we focus on the electronic structure QMC, i.e., methods relevant for systems described by the electron-ion Hamiltonians. Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of electron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable scaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and solids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of electrons while providing 90-95\% of the correlation energy and energy differences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy beyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation which is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes of fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the important topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC calculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related nodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of few-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using transformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces into the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological properties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic fermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains. Recently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals are presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first row atoms and molecules. Finally, backflow "dressed" coordinates are introduced as another possibility for capturing correlation effects and for decreasing the fixed-node bias.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the simulation of ground-state properties of interacting fermions is introduced. A trial wave function, which is assumed to be a Slater determinant, is propagated to large imaginary times. The quantum many-body propagator is represented by a coherent superposition of single-particle propagators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich trans- formation. The resulting functional integral is performed by stochastic methods based on Langevin dynamics. Numerical stability is achieved by orthonormalizing the propagating single- particle orbitals entering the Slater determinant. The problem of the positiveness of the statistical weight is addressed and solved in most cases. Illustrative examples are given for the 1D and 2D Hubbard models.},

@article{Cleland2010a,
	Abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N(2) molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10(15) with very modest computational resources.},

	Abstract = {The first ab initio potential energy surface of the Kr-OCS complex is developed using the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with noniterative inclusion of connected triples [CCSD(T)]. The mixed basis sets, aug-cc-pVTZ for the O, C, and S atom, and aug-cc-pVQZ-PP for the Kr atom, with an additional (3s3p2d1f) set of midbond functions are used. A potential model is represented by an analytical function whose parameters are fitted numerically to the single point energies computed at 228 configurations. The potential has a T-shaped global minimum and a local linear minimum. The global minimum occurs at R = 7.146 a(0), $\theta$ = 105.0$\,^{\circ}$ with energy of -270.73 cm(-1). Bound state energies up to J = 9 are calculated for three isotopomers (82)Kr-OCS, (84)Kr-OCS, and (86)Kr-OCS. Analysis of the vibrational wavefunctions and energies suggests the complex can exist in two isomeric forms: T-shaped and quasi-linear. The calculated transition frequencies and spectroscopic constants of the three isotopomers are in good agreement with the experimental values.},

	Abstract = {We study the solution of the multi-particle, time-dependent Schro ̈dinger equation using quantum Monte Carlo methods and numer- ical integration. The Monte Carlo method is based on a mixed scheme, combining classical dynamics for the nuclei and quantum mechanics for the electrons. The numerical solution uses a discretization of the Schro ̈dinger equation in real space and time. The two methods have been applied to light elements and silicon, respectively, and the dynamical events considered are the dissociation of H3 and the fragmentation of small silicon clusters. Benchmark calculations, performed for the ground state of H, He and small clusters of H and Si, are compared with Hartree--Fock calculations, also carried out in the course of this study. This comparison shows that both methods regain the exact stationary limit.},

@article{Booth2009,
	Abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

	Abstract = {For the atoms with Z ≤ 11, energies obtained using the "initiator" extension to full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC) come to within statistical errors of the FCIQMC results. As these FCIQMC values have been shown to converge onto FCI results, the i-FCIQMC method allows similar accuracy to be achieved while significantly reducing the scaling with the size of the Slater determinant space. The i-FCIQMC electron affinities of the Z ≤ 11 atoms in the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets are presented here. In every case, values are obtained to well within chemical accuracy [the mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the relativistically corrected experimental values is 0.41 mE(h)], and significantly improve on coupled cluster with singles, doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] results. Since the only remaining source of error is basis set incompleteness, we have investigated using CCSD(T)-F12 contributions to correct the i-FCIQMC results. By doing so, much faster convergence with respect to basis set size may be achieved for both the electron affinities and the FCIQMC ionization potentials presented in a previous paper. With this F12 correction, the MAD can be further reduced to 0.13 mE(h) for the electron affinities and 0.31 mE(h) for the ionization potentials.},

@article{Booth2010,
	Abstract = {A new quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method is used to calculate exact, full configuration-interaction (FCI) energies of the neutral and cationic elements from Li to Mg, in a family of commonly used basis sets. Annihilation processes between positive and negative walkers enable the exact N-electron wave function to emerge as a linear superposition of the (factorially large) space of Slater determinants, with individual determinants being stochastically sampled. As a result, extremely large spaces (exceeding 10(15) determinants) become accessible for FCI calculations. No fixed-node approximation is necessary, and the only remaining source of error is the one-electron basis set, which can be systematically reduced by enlargement of the basis set. We have investigated the family of aug-cc-pVXZ Dunning basis sets up to X=5. The resulting ionization potentials are--with one exception (Na)--consistently accurate to within chemical accuracy. The anomalous case of Na suggests that its basis set may be improvable. Extrapolation schemes are examined as a way of further improving the values obtained, and although an improvement is seen in the mean-absolute error, the results of extrapolation are not uniformly better than the largest basis set calculations reported. More generally, these results demonstrate the utility of the QMC method to provide FCI energies for realistic systems and basis sets.},

@phdthesis{James1996,
	Abstract = {The distribution and motion of electrons in atoms, molecules and solids is de- scribed by the time dependent Schro ̈dinger equation. This is extremely difficult to solve exactly because the electron-electron interactions make it impossible to separate the many-body problem into many one-body problems. In this thesis I have adopted the Monte Carlo (mc) method to confront this difficult term head on, and am able to solve the many-electron Schro ̈dinger equation almost exactly. The mc method relies on the similarity between the Schro ̈dinger equation in imaginary time and a classical diffusion equation, which can be solved by computer simulation. An ensemble of particles is chosen and each particle carries out a random walk until the distribution of particles reaches the required steady state solution. When this method is applied to the imaginary time Schro ̈dinger equation, the main difficulty is that the particles (which are not just the electrons) exist in a very high dimensional phase space. This makes finding the steady state solution a substantial exercise in computer simulation. In this thesis, I have used the mc method to calculate the ground state properties of solid and atomic Germanium. Quantum mc methods have not been applied to Germanium before, but many other theoretical approaches have been used and there is much experimental data available for comparison. The new results to be presented here fall into three categories. First, I have performed extensive calculations to find the optimum form of the wave functions to be used in mc calculations. This was achieved through the technique of variance minimisation, in which the parameters defining the wave function are varied to reduce the statistical noise in the mc results for the ground state energy. Second, I have studied the dependence of the mc energies on the size of the time step and the number of diffusing particles in the simulation. These time step and population control errors are the most important systematic errors in practical mc simulations. Third, in collaboration with Richard Needs' group in Cambridge, a solid state mc code has been used to calculate the energy versus volume curve of di- amond structure Germanium near the equilibrium volume. This work employed a correlated sampling technique, which allows energy differences to be obtained much more accurately than in conventional mc calculations, and enabled us to calculate physical quantities such as lattice constants and bulk moduli with sig- nificantly reduced statistical errors.},

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},
