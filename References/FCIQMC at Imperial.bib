abstract = {This article describes the variational and ﬁxed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods and how they may be used to calculate the properties of many-electron systems. These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},

abstract = {A new quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method is used to calculate exact, full configuration-interaction (FCI) energies of the neutral and cationic elements from Li to Mg, in a family of commonly used basis sets. Annihilation processes between positive and negative walkers enable the exact N-electron wave function to emerge as a linear superposition of the (factorially large) space of Slater determinants, with individual determinants being stochastically sampled. As a result, extremely large spaces (exceeding 10(15) determinants) become accessible for FCI calculations. No fixed-node approximation is necessary, and the only remaining source of error is the one-electron basis set, which can be systematically reduced by enlargement of the basis set. We have investigated the family of aug-cc-pVXZ Dunning basis sets up to X=5. The resulting ionization potentials are--with one exception (Na)--consistently accurate to within chemical accuracy. The anomalous case of Na suggests that its basis set may be improvable. Extrapolation schemes are examined as a way of further improving the values obtained, and although an improvement is seen in the mean-absolute error, the results of extrapolation are not uniformly better than the largest basis set calculations reported. More generally, these results demonstrate the utility of the QMC method to provide FCI energies for realistic systems and basis sets.},

@article{Slepoy2008,
abstract = {The time evolution of species concentrations in biochemical reaction networks is often modeled using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) [Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340 (1977)]. The computational cost of the original SSA scaled linearly with the number of reactions in the network. Gibson and Bruck developed a logarithmic scaling version of the SSA which uses a priority queue or binary tree for more efficient reaction selection [Gibson and Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 1876 (2000)]. More generally, this problem is one of dynamic discrete random variate generation which finds many uses in kinetic Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation. We present here a constant-time algorithm, whose cost is independent of the number of reactions, enabled by a slightly more complex underlying data structure. While applicable to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in general, we describe the algorithm in the context of biochemical simulations and demonstrate its competitive performance on small- and medium-size networks, as well as its superior constant-time performance on very large networks, which are becoming necessary to represent the increasing complexity of biochemical data for pathways that mediate cell function.},

A trial wave function, which is assumed to be a Slater determinant, is propagated to large imaginary times. The quantum many-body propagator is represented by a coherent superposition of single-particle propagators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich trans- formation. The resulting functional integral is performed by stochastic methods based on Langevin dynamics. Numerical stability is achieved by orthonormalizing the propagating single- particle orbitals entering the Slater determinant. The problem of the positiveness of the statistical weight is addressed and solved in most cases. Illustrative examples are given for the 1D and 2D Hubbard models.},

@article{Cleland2010,
abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N(2) molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10(15) with very modest computational resources.},

We identify the correlation within the population of walkers as the dominant scaling factor for large systems. While this factor is negligible for small and medium sized systems that are typically studied, it ultimately shows exponential scaling. The scaling factor can be estimated straightforwardly for each specific system and we find that is typically only becomes relevant for systems containing more than several hundred atoms.},

@article{Booth2009,
abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},
