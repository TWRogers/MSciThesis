Thank you to Prof. Matthew Foulkes and Dr. James Spencer who thought of the original idea for this project and provided a great deal of help both in the physics and the computing that resulted in the achievement of these results. Many thanks also to my project-partner Nicholas Blunt, with whom the work in this project is equally shared. Finally, I am grateful for discussions on the application of DMQMC in quantum information theory with Dr. Terry Rudolph and of Tom Poole for proof-reading this report and offering some important changes.

This work made use of the Imperial College High Performance Computing facilities.
